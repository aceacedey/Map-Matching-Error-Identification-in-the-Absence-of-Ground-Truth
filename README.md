Validation and performance assessment of the automatic error identification require ground truth data for the map-matched segments.
Since the ground truth of map-matched segment data is not available with large-trajectory datasets, we apply visual inspection of the map-matched segments, applying the criteria of reasonable sequencing.
To realize the visual inspection, I have developed an interactive, map-based tool called O_VisTool. 
The recorded GNSS points will pop up as red dots and map-matched segments are shown as blue markers with popup numbers. 
The tool tracks user interactions where the map-matched segments can be clicked as a ground truth error by a human inspector.
